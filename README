# Screamer extension

Funny extension that screams if you spend too much time on selected web-sites

## About

Initially, this extension supposed to be a joking answer to my friend's tweet.
It would use famous Kaspersky Antivirus pig scream, if you spent more than one minute on Twitter page.
But I could not resist the urge to make area of application a little wider.
So, now it allows to set your own time limit, provide list of sites and choose one of 3 sounds (with loop option):

* Antivirus pig scream
* Civil Protection siren
* Digital alarm clock beep

While this extension is still kind of joke, you can use it as a legitimate time saving and digital well-being tool.
